      <h3>Description :</h3>

      <p>
        Chocolate crinkle cookies have become a holiday staple, but they're also
        great any time of year. They're cake-like cookies made with unsweetened
        cocoa powder, vegetable oil, and a handful of other pantry staple
        ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before baking, the cookies are coated in confectioners' sugar. When they
        bake up, they end up with a cracked (or "crinkled") effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        They're the perfect cookie for brownie or Devil's food cake lovers
        because of their rich, fudgy flavor and texture.
